			<p id="first">Welcome to your new summer job at <strong>Freddy Fazbear's Pizza</strong>, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see!

			The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course, and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds!

			The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman. From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night — no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right — namely, if Freddy Fazbear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!

			Can you <em>survive</em> <strong>Five Nights at Freddy's</strong>?</p>

		<h3 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h3>
					
		<p id="second">The player sits in an office and monitors security cameras positioned throughout the restaurant to observe the animatronic mascots. The player has a limited amount of power to view camera feeds, light hallways, and close the doors on either side of them. The player must use the camera feed locations in the building, and hold the animatronics off using the doors. If the player fails to do this, they will be killed with a jumpscare. To advance to the next night, the player must survive from 12:00 AM until 6:00 AM (8 minutes and 36 seconds in real-time).</p>

		<h4 id="characters">Characters</h4>
				
					<ul>
					
		<li><p>Freddy Fazbear is the main antagonist in Five Nights at Freddy's. He is an animatronic bear who is left in a <em>"free roaming mode"</em> at midnight, when he wanders <br/>around Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, along with the other animatronics, until 6 AM. He forcibly stuffs any human he encounters after hours into a Freddy Fazbear suit, as do the other animatronics.</p></li>
					
		<li><p>Bonnie is one of four main antagonists in Five Nights at Freddy's. Like Freddy and Chica, Bonnie is a children's entertainer during the day, housed at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. However, at night, he acts as the other animatronics do: hunting down any human in the area and forcibly stuffing them into a Freddy Fazbear suit, killing them.</p></li>
						
		<li><p>Chica is one of the five antagonists in Five Nights at Freddy's. Chica is a robotic children's entertainer housed at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, along with Freddy and Bonnie. She is the back-up singer in the Fazbear band. During the night, along with the other animatronics, she will try to force any human or endoskeleton she sees into an animatronic suit.</p></li>
						
		<li><p>Foxy is an antagonist in Five Nights at Freddy's. His starting location is behind the curtain in Pirate Cove, from which he emerges and sprints towards The Office to attack the player on any given night if he is monitored too much or too little (with the exception of The 2nd Night) through the security camera.
				Unlike other animatronics in the game, Foxy will hide for a while before coming to attack the player. It is currently unknown as to why Foxy is the only animatronic who hides.</p></li>
						
		<li><p>Golden Freddy (also known as Ghost Freddy and referred to as Yellow Bear in the game's files) is one of the five antagonists and a special animatronic in Five Nights at Freddy's. He is a secret, golden version of Freddy Fazbear who appears in The Office after a certain sequence of events are triggered.</p></li>
						
		<li><p>Mike Schmidt is the main protagonist in Five Nights at Freddy's. He is a security guard employed by Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. The game is played in first-person perspective, through Mike's eyes.</p></li>
						
		<li><p>Phone Guy is the deuteragonist of Five Nights at Freddy's. He is the previous security guard at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, during the events of the game.</p></li>
